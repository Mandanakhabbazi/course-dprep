# Preparation before the course starts

This course requires an advanced software setup before you can get started. So, please spend some time carefully working through the software installation guide!

- [Install software (R & RStudio, Git, automation & build tools) now](../../../docs/tutorials/software-installation/_index.md)

We also use some premium content of Datacamp.com, so make sure to sign up using your Tilburg University account to be able to follow the material.
