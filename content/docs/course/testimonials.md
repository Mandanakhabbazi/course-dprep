# Student acknowledgements

To get an idea of how students of previous editions of this course thought of this course, we included some of main points that were mentioned in the course evaluation by them below.

## About the course
- _Genuinely one of the best courses I have taken.
The course material teach some very valuable
skills. I liked the way pulse was used to have a
clear view of task to do weekly and to keep up with
the material._

- _I really liked how the lectures were done and
that it was really an addition to the online work you
had to do. This complemented each other well_

- _It was very practical and I quickly learnt new
skills_

- _Overall, what I learned is completely new and
valuable. It's up to date with everyone in the field
use_

- _I really liked the fact that we learned some new
skills. I liked it very much and it was interesting._

## About the team project and tutorials

- _I really have the feeling that I learned a lot in just
a few weeks. I got really excited every time I
understood the tutorials, which made me even
more enthusiastic to learn more and more :)_

- _I really liked the structure of die course. The
overview of what had to be done was really clear.
Also the datacamp tutorials, combined with
practice assignments were really helpfull in
understanding the material. And I really liked the
project. Every thing that we learned in the tutorials
and in the assignments we could use in practice.
The project was really well aligned with the course
material._

- _1. Pulse really helped me as an overview of what
had to be done for a particular week. 2. The project
was fun to work on. It also helped me to use the
'theory' and do something with it and get better
skills and understanding._
