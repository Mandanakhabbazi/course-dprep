# Tutorial: Project Management and Version Control with Git/GitHub

## Learning goals

* Setup Git and GitHub, and know what both are
* Experience the power of file versioning (e.g., restoring, branching) from the command line/terminal
* Apply the end-to-end Git workflow, using simple text files created in the editor
* Learn to collaborate on projects using GitHub

## Planning

* Please plan about one day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting Started

1. Preparation before the in-class tutorial
    - Develop your command line (Windows) / terminal (Mac) skills ([first chapter only](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell))
    - [Familiarize yourself with GitHub by working on this tutorial!](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)


{{< hint info >}}
Also check out [this presentation about the command line / terminal](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl). Though it is targeted to Mac users, it provides a great overview. Windows users could still follow along using *the same commands* by using Git Bash (or Cygwin). The main goal here is to understand how directory structures work and how to navigate in the terminal or command line.
