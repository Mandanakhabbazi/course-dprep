# Tutorial: Project Management and Version Control with Git/GitHub

## Learning goals

* Setup Git and GitHub, and know what both are
* Experience the power of file versioning (e.g., restoring, branching) from the command line/terminal
* Apply the end-to-end Git workflow, using simple text files created in the editor
* Learn to collaborate on projects using GitHub

## Planning

* Please plan about one day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting Started

1. Develop your command line (Windows) / terminal (Mac) skills:
    - What is the [command line / terminal](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl)?!

{{< hint info >}}
Though the contents of the presentation above are demonstrated with a Mac, Windows users can still follow along by installing Cygwin or using Git Bash, for example. The main goal here is to understand how directory structures work and how to navigate in the terminal or command line.

2. [Familiarize yourself with GitHub by working on this tutorial!](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)

3. Apply the end-to-end Git workflow using Git Bash (i.e., through the command line) ([View tutorial](version-control.html))

__Curious how to use Git with a graphical user interface?__
(optional, but highly useful)

- [Sourcetreeapp](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) is a free Git client for Windows, Mac and Linux!
- Git also [smoothly integrates with R - find out how!](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/)
