# Tutorial: R Bootcamp

Datasets have become massive and demands for tools that can handle such data have increased. R provides you with a toolbox to handle and analyze large data sets. As such, it's not surprising R skills have become mandatory for any job  related to marketing analytics or data science.

## Learning goals

* Finding your way around R and RStudio
* Create and handle various data types in R (e.g., vector, matrix, dataframe)
* Change the content of data frames (e.g., create, drop, or rename columns)
* Read data from text files into data frames in R
* Basic data wrangling with dplyr/tidyverse
<!--Filter data in data frames (e.g., by index, logical expressions, missing records, etc.)
-->
<!--  * Apply basic programming concepts (if-else statements, for-loop, functions )
-->
