# Tutorial: Engineering data sets


## Learning goals

* Merge data sets on one or more indices and understand the different types of joins (inner, left, right join)
* Handle and preprocess string data (remove characters, splitting)
* Apply a variety of feature engineering techniques (grouping, rank, counter)
* Document code and analyses with RMarkdown


## Planning

- Please plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting started

1. In-class tutorial ([view slides](tutorial.html)

2. After-class exercises ([View](data-preparation.html), [Download; right click - download file as](data-preparation.Rmd))



<!--
### Create (Data Challenge #2)
- Create an RMarkdown report in which you explore open-ended questions! Start from the answer skeleton ([View](data-report.html), [Download; right click - download file as](data-report.Rmd))

If you like, you can submit your exercises and/or data challenge as a "proof of investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment).
