# Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for the estimation of relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It can be used to find trends in data, assess the strength of the relationship between variables, and for modelling the future relationship between them for unseen data.

This building block contains the necessary code snippets to estimate a model, identify outliers, plot a trend line, and make predictions.

Furthermore, this example illustrates how to combine these regression analysis “building blocks” to run, evaluate and export linear regression model results. In particular, we analyze the relationship between a car’s speed and the stop distance. First, we check the model assumptions and screen for potential outliers. Second, we export our regression results into a format that you can easily copy into word processing software. Third, we build a scatter plot with the trend line on top of it. Fourth and last, we make predictions for unseen data points.
