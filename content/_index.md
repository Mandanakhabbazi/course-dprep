__Why should you take this course?__

Many students and researchers perceive the process of doing research as rather simplistic: a bit of data cleaning here and analysis there, and you're done. While this mostly isn't a problem when working on small-scale projects, this approach won't work anymore once you work on your empirical theses (e.g., for Marketing Analytics), or join an analytics-focused company.

Therefore, in this course, you will professionalize your way-of-working. In particular, we'll zoom in on complex, reproducible data preparation workflows (think of structured and unstructured raw data, derived from multiple sources, provided in multiple delivery batches, with lots of missing data, etc.).

Throughout the course, you'll be using workflow principles of reproducible science that are documented at [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com). This open source platform will likely become your go-to page for analytics and workflow related issues for years to come.

## This website

This website is the backbone of the course, and features the following main sections.

- The [__course__](docs/course) section features the syllabus, schedule, and grading details.

- The [__tutorial__](docs/tutorials) section offers self-guided tutorials that teach the *principles* of data preparation and workflow management. <!--It also holds a (weekly) data challenge in which you can put your skills into practice. <!--Use these to start your own empirical research projects! <!--a workflow for collecting online data, and -->

- Finally, this course uses [__building blocks__](docs/building-blocks) and [__examples__](docs/examples) to provide solutions and inspiration for your project work.
